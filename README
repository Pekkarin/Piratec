Piratec version 0.0F Final testing version 02 Nov 2011

Final testing. Basic frame is now working, going to alpha-state.
Until release (1) I'am trying to implement all important Piratebay
features (such as categories) and keep bugs and too-ugly-monkey-code
out.

--

Description:

The Piratebay Commandline search and download util.
Not torrent client, used only for fast search and torrent-download.
Consider using with rtorrent and auto-trigger torrent-folder.

--

Usage: piratec -h | --help
       piratec -s | --search "search string".
       piratec -a |Â --about
       piratec -v | --version
       #not implemented in this version: {piratec -c | --category TESTING!
	  
	   #Example: piratec -s archlinux
       #Categories: 100 music, 200 movies, 300 apps, 400 games
	   #Example: piratec -c 300,400 -s linux
       #Menu:  
	   
	   After search, hits are shown in a numbered list. You may download
       correspondin torrent by it's number, by hitting 'd'.
       
       Hit 'h' for this help, and obviously 'q' for quits.

Misc:  - Using "piratec -s" without string parameter shows recent additions to site.
         Consider it as bug;).
       - You should edit config-file to change settings.
       - In crash or ctrl-c quits temporary files are not deleted until next run.
