The Piratebay CLI Version 0.2 (30 Oct 2011) 

Extremely simple Piratebay torrent download script. 
Uses lynx and wget among classic gnu core utils as grep, cut, sed etc.
Script shoud be able to run in any *nix with lynx and wget.

Usage: piratec -h | --help
       piratec -s | --search "search string".
       piratec -a |Â --about

       Example: piratec -s archlinux

Menu:  After search, hits are shown in a numbered list. You may download
       correspondin torrent by it's number, by hitting 'd'.
       
       You may jump pages by pressing 'p' and giving page number. Note that pages 
       starts from 0.

       Hit 'h' for this help, and obviously 'q' for quits.

Misc:  - Using "piratec -s" without string parameter shows recent additions to site.
       - You should edit piratec-file to change settings.
       - In crash or ctrl-c quits temporary files are not deleted until next run.

Piratebay search is kinda simple: "thepiratebay.org/seach/<string>/0" for first page.
thepiratebay.org/search/1" for next and so on.
